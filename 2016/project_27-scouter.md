# Scouter

## Introduction
Point your camera to the person in front of you and see his heart beat in real-time.


## Description
Scouter is an AR app with face-recognition that displays the person's real-time heartbeat on screen. The heartbeat feed is provided by an IoT device placed on the person's body.

Scouter is inspired by the device from Dragon Ball Z specially used to measure power levels. A device that we wished very much to be real.

The good news is that it's 2016, and we have now the needed technology to do it. Maybe not to measure Power Levels, but to show other interesting info from the person in front of you.

At Pixels Camp we are starting **V1, which has the goal of recognizing the person in front of you and show his heartbeat in real-time**.

**Later, Scouter takes a broader angle, and will integrate different APIs so that can display on screen more rich data about the person**, as: 
* Twitter feed;
* Places you both have been (via Foursquare);
* Tastes in common (via Facebook);
* Github Repos to which they have contributed, etc.

It will be like Dragon Ball Z's Scouters, but better.

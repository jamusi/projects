__It's a pixel spreading disease battle.__

Open the game link (with your login in pixels.camp) and you will see your custom _el__pixel_ with your team color; Then put a smile on your face and start spreading your pixel â€“ New, converted team members will now help you on your quest to become the ultimate army team.

Which pixel will prevail during the battle? #Wololo

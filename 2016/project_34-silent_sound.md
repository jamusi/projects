# Silent Sound

## Introduction

Silent Sound is a medium of sending messages using high frequency sounds

## Description

We have two parts to the tecnology:
* Processor/Emitter: where we hope to be able to embed an inaudible sound matching a specific message on video and audio files
* Receiver: where we can process incoming audio and recover the embedded messages within

This technology serves as a proof of concept for a different medium to send messages across audiences where there's no pairing between sender/receiver (i.e. television or radio broadcasting). But it can also be used for closed proximity communication.

On Pixels Camp we will be showcasing it as a sound QR code and we are working on a special treat for our presentation.

We are using the following technologies:
- Languages: Crystal / Matlab
- Database: Redis
- Others: AWS S3 / Heroku

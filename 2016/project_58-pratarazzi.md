# Pratarazzi

## Introduction

An app to identify the great dishes you ate but you don't remember the name.

## Description

Sometimes, speacially when your travelling, you eat a great local dish you take a pic, to share on instagram or whatever, but when it's time to #hashtag it you don't remember the name! So what you gonna do? Go back to the restaurant and ask the waitress? Give it a generic #hashtag like, delicious, omnomnom or ,foodporn? NO! Open the image in Pratazzi and it will identify it, and give you name of the dishe so you can hashtag it properly!

We will start with an android app that will use image recognition services to identify the images (Microsoft Vision, Google Vision or others that work).

# Fog of World

## Introduction

Fog of World is a concept based on strategy games' Fog of War but applied to the real world.

## Description

A user starts in an unexplored world, with a foggy map and, as he moves, the explored areas will start displaying the map that's behind the fog. The concept can then be extended to multiple applications, like adding achievements for explored areas, co-op play domination games, tracking games, treasure hunt,...

The concept could be applied as a game that would target most casual gamers.

Some of the technologies used in the building of this concept are: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, React and WebGL.

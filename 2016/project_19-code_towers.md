# CodeTowers

## Introduction

A tower defense game against the machine where you program the behavior of your turrets in JavaScript.

## Description

CodeTowers is a web browser game that lets people practice their JavaScript skills against the machine. The game is very similar to classic Tower Defense games, but in this version the player must program the behavior of their turrets using JavaScript.

The target audience are both people still learning how to code, but alo experienced coders who want to pown our machine.

The entirety of the game is written in JavaScript using pentagine.js.

A simple snippet looks like this:

```javascript
function(enemies, powerups) {
  if (enemies.length) {
    turn(calcAngle(enemies[0]));
    shoot();
  }
}
```

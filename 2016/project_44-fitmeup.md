## Description
 
The software helps athletes keep their performance and count by monitoring their movements in real time.
We use a common place kinect v2 with a simple PC and analyze up to six bodies at the same time. We also provide a virtual green screen for avataring and placement on the game arena.
This should ideally be placed on a gym environment for space and team usage.
On the future this allows more movements to be programmed and additional statistics, like time in movement, velocity, aceleration and explosiveness.
We can also set a pacer for completing the movements in

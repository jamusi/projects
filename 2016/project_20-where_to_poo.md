# Where to poo?

## Introduction

Sometimes we need to find a toilet... hardly!

## Description

Real life story... it happened to everybody at least once: we are strolling and
everything starts to look lesser and lesser interesting. The sights still 
awesome, the weather is perfect but... our inners require us to look for a 
place to release some of the load.

Where will we find a cosy clean toillet? Well... We all have smartphones in 
our pockets and there are network connections in every corner of every street!

 * It allows us to locate the nearest toillet... or the cleanest... or the one 
equiped with baby changer!
 * This application is targeted to all travelers... in need!
 * The application will be built over Ionic and server side will use Redis 
(for caching), MariaDB and Flask.

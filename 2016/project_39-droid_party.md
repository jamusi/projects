# Droid Party

## Introduction

What if you could get a bunch of friends together and experience the thrill of Mario Party with just your phone? This is the app for your partying needs!

## Description

Droid Party is a mobile app to make the best out of a party. A series of thrilling minigames are played in successive fashion, with one player becoming the reigning champion. Although there is only one winner, some minigames have team characteristics in the veign of "coopetition" matches. Our goal is for you to recall the stressful - yet good - times you had when playing games like Mario Party or Buzz, but in a more modern, easy to use, comfortable and distributed way.

Our audience is anyone who wishes to have some fun at their parties. People currently tend to play group games such as Duck Game for a similar kind of thrill, but we like to think we can do better. In a future and much more polished version, we'd also like to include a world-wide/nation-wide leaderboard, allowing you to play from your home with people from around the globe.

The project is made for Android. A backend, written in Java, coordinates all of the players' devices and ensures they are in sync. The communication protocol is defined on top of TCP. Since this is a hackathon project, if we continue development on it, we expect to rewrite significant portions of the protocol further down the line.

## Other information

We regret to inform the world that we lack a designer. Our product is merely a very crude and frankly very ugly prototype meant to be seen as a proof of concept on which future work can be built upon.

# Team'd Up

## Introduction

Need a team? Stop building one, hire one.

## Description

Too much time is spent building teams based on individual hires. Hiring individually has the expense of finding, onboarding, and training a replacement. There's also the uncertainty of how a new employee will work out and all the hardship on the rest of your staff until positions can be filled / up-to-date. 

For these reasons, we thought we should idealize and prototype a platform for teams so teams can be hired altogether. Woudln't it be awesome if you worked with your pixels camp colleagues out in the real world?

Technology wise, we're building this using react and react-router and materializeCSS. It's just a client-side app with no backend or database.

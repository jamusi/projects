Kardash.it

Introduction

Kardash.it assures you only buy clothes with style. By analysing past sales it predicts what humans love and eliminate all the fugly stuff you (or your mother) thinks is cute and would otherwise buy.

Description

Kardash.it predictions are based on a neural network with the power to make Google twice as fast or slower... we don't really know. We just used the sales data on 6787 products SONAE was kind enough to make available.

We fed the data of the 6787 products to our algorithm that after eating and digesting everything dumped its predictions on which products would flop and which would actually sell.

To make this work we used C# and Python, no apples where used to develop this product.

Other information

The only current negative side of our technology is that it makes everyone look a lot prettier and generates too much tinder matches for its users. In the future retail will die and we will be able to use our neural network to select the humans with specific traits above average (fun, pretty face, don't consider voting for Trump, ...) and randomly advise them to buy stuff most people find ugly.

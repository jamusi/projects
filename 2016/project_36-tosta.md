## Introduction

`-----`

tosta

`-----`

The Original Soundtrack Application of your instagram.

## Description

With a single button click, tOSTa will analyse tags, descriptions and suggest a soundtrack for your latest photos. It also uses the main colours from each photo to collect information about their mood.

This application is for any instagramer who likes to take photos on holidays, trips or simply their favorites lunches.

tOSTa will be a single button Ruby on Rails(5) web application. We will use LastFM to search for musics, and spotify to automatically create the playlist of your holidays - _tosta mix_.

# TalkPocket

## Introduction

Make your favorite articles talk without hassle!

## Description

Gather articles from a given URL and converts it to audio, storing it for your convenience.

Then, using this API, our frontend will give you all your converted articles for easy access!

To achieve this we use:
  * Clojure - Because it's awesome...
  * Core.async - Does all the talk between processes
  * React - Frontend magic
  * Diffbot API - Simple way of extracting information from articles
  * Watson API - AI Magic!
  * Cassandra - Store information
  * Minio - Store files

This was made for users that love podcasts instead of reading making it easier for them to follow their favorite bloggers without looking at all those annoying letters.

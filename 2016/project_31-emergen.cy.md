# Emergen.cy


## Introduction

Our idea is to modernize the way companies elaborate and execute their emergency plan.


## Description

The purpose of Emergen.cy is to provide an easy way to manage a company emergency plan. 

Some of the things that Emergen.cy can do are:

 * Can identify the roles of the emergency coordinators
 * The app will be an assistant of the emergency procedure, by:
   * Alerting the users in the building that an emergecy plan is running
   * Provides an panic button to alert a coordinator that someone is stuck
   * Show the nearest escape route and meeting point
   * On the coordinator side, can show a checklist of the people that are still on the building, and those that are already safe
 
This beeing, all companies are potencial adopters.

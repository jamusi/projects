# PonGo

## Introduction

PonGo is a GPS based game, inspired on pong, played with the smartphone.

## Description

This project is a game, that should be played with the smartphone. The users have to change the direction of the ball and make it leave the game area on the opposite side.

Using his smartphone, the game creator chooses the field on the world map and kickstarts the game. The ball starts rolling and players have to move in the real world to play. The player that makes the ball leave the area more times wins the game.

The intended audience is all the people that like games that interact with the real world.

For this prototype built during the pixels.camp hackathon, we will develop a native Android app and a server component (built using node.js). For the communication we are still evaluating some alternatives, but it will most certainly be done using Ably.io.

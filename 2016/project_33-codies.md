## Introduction

Programming for preschollers

## Description

The importance of teaching programming to children is growing and is
acknowledged by educators and policy makers around the world: many countries
already include programming in elementary school (Portugal started a two-year pilot-project
in 2015).

But what if we could teach them even sooner, at preschool?

This project will bring this vision to life, respecting the needs of 3 to 5 years
old children: real objects that manipulate a real robot.

Programming blocks that will be safe and fun to use, with zero-configuration,
no educator training needed. Implemented using low cost electronics (ATMega
chips, the brains of Arduinos), so it can be afordable to every type of
preschool and even families.

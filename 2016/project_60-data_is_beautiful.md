# Data Is Beautiful

## Introduction

Website for data visualization related with the NOS Challenge

## Description

We are creating a portal for visualization of the dataset #1 of the NOS challenge. The ideia is to show the movement and flow related to the NOS ALIVE event. We are also looking for patterns related with the path of each individual inside the country on the days before and after the event.

We are using Python and Javascript.

# GRIZZLY

## Introduction

A simple solution to an older problem. Direct communication between publishers and subscribers.

## Description

Today, our devices are our main feed of news, with all kind of notifications, so, instead of annoy your customers with emails that most of times get lost in junk folders or no one read it. Why not use a platform that provides a direct channel of communication to your customers? A global platform that customers trust to only receive subscribed information that respects their choices.  

Today we can communicate with each other in direct and easy way, but when we look to the tools that businesses have to reach their customers through a direct message, they still depend on classic email newsletters with all known technical issues like guarantee of deliver and bounces or more recent, the social networks posts that may or not appear to their followers.  

Our purpose is to solve this problem, by ending up with the newsletters by email, and replacing them by a simple app platform called GRIZZLY, where customers subscribe feeds of information from businesses through GRIZZLY, with no email or cellphone number associated. 

Is a win-win, GRIZZLY guarantees respect of privacy, customers receive directly in their devices the newsletter and businesses has a trust report about views, which percentage of newsletter has been read and 100% guarantee of deliverability.

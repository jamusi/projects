# MyDash

## Introduction

MyDash is a personal dashboard that provides the information that you need at any moment. You can know if this month, you payed more for electricity, or if any missing pending bills needs to be paid.

## Description

Have you ever forgot to pay a bill, or you don't have notion if this month you paid more electricity than expected because of that new gadget? Did you ever wish that your service providers would API call "your app" to enter a new bill rather than sending an email with an attached PDF?
With MyDash, you have your own personal dashboard, filled with data visualizations. Data can either be inserted manually by you, or your service providers (electricity, water, cable, ...) may use the API to enter your bills using your userKey. We will use NodeJS and MongoDB for the Backend, Angular for the frontend.
